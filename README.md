# [spxcmd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iAmSpace/school-computer-exploits/main/spxcmd.bat)

A batch version of the Windows Command Prompt. This exists to bypass the message that reads "Command Prompt has been disabled by your administrator." or something like that. It's nothing special, but a useful tool.

Where do I even get started lol... I got bored and I decided to make Minecraft work. To run it, make sure that the preconfigured path by me (Desktop\this_shouldnt_work\.minecraft) exists. If it does not exist, **you have extracted it wrong**. After that, all you have to do is go into that path and double click "start forge(.bat)". If you do not trust that Inertia is safe just remove it from the mods folder, and if you want to change your username, please edit the **start forge.bat** file by Left Click (Single) > Right Click > Edit, you will see it as `--username Telecode` but yeah, if it really bugs you, you can infact change it.
